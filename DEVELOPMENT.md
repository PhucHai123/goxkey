## Local development setup

To setup the project locally, first, checkout the code and run the install script to have all the Git hooks configured:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/huytd/goxkey && cd goxkey
$ make setup
```

After this step, you can use the `make` commands to run or bundle the code as needed:

```sh
$ make run

# or

$ make bundle
```
